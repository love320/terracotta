This directory contains scripts and configuration files that are useful for
working with the Subversion version control system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
config
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file 'config' is a Subversion configuration file that can be used for
setting configuration data for Subversion.  Of particular importance are
the various auto-props properties that are contained in this file, which
apply various properties to files as they are added to the Subversion
repository, based on file name patterns.

To use the config file, save it in the Subversion configuration area.  On
Linux, Mac OS X, and other UNIX-like systems, the Subversion configuration
area is the .subversion directory inside of your home directory.  On Windows,
the situation is more complicated, but it is usually
C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Application Data\Subversion .

svnmerge.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the script used for merging, which developers really should use unless
you want (and know how) to use another method.  See the developer documentation
for instruction on how to use it.
