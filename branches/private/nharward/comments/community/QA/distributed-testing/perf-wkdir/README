This README pertains to the following files:

	- hosts
	- http-load-client.properties
	- license.lic
	- tc-config.xml
	
OVERVIEW:
	
	This environment allows you to move compiled Eclipse code from your local
	machine to a series of dedicated (Linux) machines used in session replication
	performance testing. The bin directory provides the necessary scrips to begin
	a "perf" test and collect it's results.
	
SETUP:

	Each configured machine will need a directory named "working" in it's user's
	home directory. You will need to configure ssh keys allowing the master-node
	to connect with each other node. You will need a copy of the
	"container-installs" directory placed in the working directory. 
	
	NOTE: container-installs contains Tomcat and WebLogic downloaded from
		http://kong.terracotta.lan/resources/resources/appservers/tc-archives/
		
		- Standard Tomcat5.0.28 download in .jar form
		- tc-weblogic81/server (just the server directory of WLS81)

FILE DESCRIPTIONS:

	"hosts" - lists the machines used for the function of: master-node (primary
	load client), l1 (container hosts), l2 (cluster admin server), 2ndLoad (other
	load clients)

	"http-load-client.properties" - lists the hosts which will be paged by the
	load clients, the number of threads (per load client), sessions (per load
	client), and session sticky ratio (100 sticky will ensure that a session
	remains bound to the machine which created it).

	"license.lic" - required by terracotta servers

	"tc-config.xml" - you must edit this file to match your specific cluster
	environment

IMPORTANT SCRIPTS:

	mv-to-master.sh - will compile, generate (war) and move the entire
	"perf-wkdir" to the master-node.
	
	-- THE REMAINING SCRIPTS DESCRIBED MUST BE RUN FROM THE "MASTER-NODE" --

	killalljava.sh - kills all java processes on each machine in the cluster

	run-containers-standalone.sh - starts each container in the cluster

	run.sh - deploys and runs the entire clustered performance test from start to
	finish
