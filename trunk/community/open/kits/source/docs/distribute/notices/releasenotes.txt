Improvements and New Features for v2.2
======================================

JVM and Platform Component Support:

1) TBD...

2) TBD...

Configuration:

The Terracotta configuration file format has changed in the following ways:

1) The XML namespace has changed permanently changed from
   http://www.terracottatech.com/config-V1
   to http://www.terracotta.org/config.

2) The following elements have been removed because the associated
   functionality has been removed:

 - system elements http-enabled and http-port; there is no longer
   a customer-facing embedded web server

 - system element jmx-enabled and server element jmx-port; JMX is
   now required

 - system element jmx-http-enabled and server element jmx-http-port;
   the HTTP interface to JMX in the server has been removed

 - application DSO element change-listener; it was felt this feature
   was being misused
   
 - client DSO element max-in-memory-object and server DSO element
   server-cached-object-count; a new memory manager has been
   introduced that uses a threshold-based eviction policy

 - application element jdbc, system element jdbc-enabled and server
   element jdbc-port; the JDBC product has been removed

Usability:

1) If you were specifying a client configuration via the servers HTTP port
   like so:

   -Dtc.config=http://[server-host]:[http-port]/config

   You should now specify the server host, dso-port tuple like so:

   -Dtc.config=[server-host]:[dso-port]

2) The 'demo' server configuration mode has been removed and the remaining
   'development' and 'production' modes have been simplified. In development
   mode a DSO client may use any configuration source and it is up to the
   developer to ensure the configuration does not clash with other client
   configuration. In production mode, it is enforced that the server is
   the client configuration source, as specified by
   -Dtc.config=[server-host]:[dso-port].


Known Issues
============
- Support for GNU Trove for high performance collections includes THashMap
  and THashSet.  However, these classes allow for a pluggable hashing
  strategy, and Terracotta does not maintain this aspect of the instance's
  state.

- The initial capacity and load factor attributes of a shared
  java.util.Map (HashMap, TreeMap, THashMap, etc.) are not preserved in the
  shared versions.

- There is a known performance issue using the fill(), sort(), and equals()
  methods of java.util.Arrays on shared objects.  Adjust the includes and
  excludes of the configuration file so the array is not part of the DSO
  object graph.

- Use of Spring Web Flow with Terracotta for Spring requires at a minimum
  Spring Web Flow 1.0 RC3.

- Distributed method calls are by design invoked asynchronously
  throughout the cluster.  The original caller of the distributed method
  will block only until DSO has recorded the method call.  If a node
  exits before it is sent the asynchronous distributed call, it will
  never invoke the method call locally (since the VM has exited).

- The JMX sample application shipped with Terracotta for Spring requires an
  MBean server.  The sample application may not function properly when run
  on BEA WebLogic 8.1 with JRE 1.4 as the application was not designed and
  tested with WebLogic's MBean server.
