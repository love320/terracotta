Known Issues

    *  This release supports the use of the THashMap and THashSet classes from the trove library 
       (http://trove4j.sourceforge.net/, only version 1.1b5 is officially supported in this release). THashMap and THashSet 
       support the use of user customized hashing strategies through via the 
       TObjectHashingStrategy interface. When distributing THashMap/THashSet instances, only the 
       default hashing strategy is supported. Any custom hash strategy will not be honored across 
       the cluster.


    * Terracotta Sessions Configurator creates a test environment that depends
      on running two domains (instances) of a web container (AppServer) from a
      single install source. IBM WebSphere CE does not support multiple
      domains in a manner that is compatible with Configurator. However, you
      can use Configurator to test a web application deployed on Apache
      Tomcat. After you have configured your web application to run clustered
      with Terracotta Sessions, use the generated tc-config.xml file to deploy
      the web application on IBM WebSphere CE running with Terracotta
      Sessions.

    * OOME in Permspace

      SEVERE: Error deploying web application directory search
      org.apache.commons.logging.LogConfigurationException:
      java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space (Caused by java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space) at
      org.apache.commons.logging.impl.LogFactoryImpl.newInstance(LogFactoryImpl.java:538) at ...

      Increase the permspace by passing the correct jvm arguments.

    * Max server object count capped by int
      There could be some unexpected behaviour if the database has more than max int/2 objects in it.

    * Possible double notifies after server restart
      It is possible to receive double notifies on server restart
          o This is caused by
                + Thread1 is selected to be the notified thread in the server and the
                  notification succeeds
                + The server crashes
                + When the server comes back up and the outstanding transactions are re-sent, the server chooses a different thread to be the notified thread and THAT notify also succeeds.
          o The solution is
                + On the receiving client side, keep track of the server transaction id that caused the notify.
                + On client reconnect, the client lock state should contain the notifier
                  server transaction id
                + The server lock manager can then decide whether or not to choose a notified
                  thread for a given transaction based on whether that transaction's notified
                  thread has already been applied
