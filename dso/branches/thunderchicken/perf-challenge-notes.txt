From Saro's email about rules:
  The following scenarios are some that will be demonstrated.
   - Start 1'st writer - show TPS, loop time, stable avg loop time
   - Start 2'nd writer - reasonable time for faulting data from L2, time for first loop
   - Second L1 reaches same stable avg loop time as 1'st one
   - Scale to 4 writers now - show scale
   - Add 2 readers - constant read/write throughput
   - Run DGC - still constant throughput
   - Restart a couple of L1s
   - Restart L2

From Juris:
to build the kit: ./tcbuild dist
without ivy: ./tcbuild dist --no-ivy
without compile: ./tcbuild dist --no-compile
to build just the jars: ./tcbuild dist_jars
(--no-ivy --no-compile applies)

running the server without a null point exception:
in sample dir, ./bin/tc-start-server.sh -n primary
