README - Dashboard

1) Unzip to target machines
2) create a link called "tc" in your home directory to point to your tc install
3) create a link called "local" in your home directory to point to the local directory (normally /export1/dev/username in our eng/perf boxes) This directory should exist in all machines
4) change tc-config to have the server name set to your L2 box
5) bin directory contains all the scripts you need to run the test.
6) src directory contains the source of the app


Enjoy !
