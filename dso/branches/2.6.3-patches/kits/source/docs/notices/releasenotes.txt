PATCH HISTORY

-------------
Patch Level 1
- - https://jira.terracotta.org/jira/browse/DEV-1875
- Fix for Cluster Statistics Recorder where it was not respecting the bind configuration
  parameter and could not connect to the server.

-------------
Patch Level 2

- https://jira.terracotta.org/jira/browse/CDV-874
- The JMX connection URL created by the AdminConsole replaces the passed in server hostname 
  with the actual host addresss. This bypasses ssh tunneling. It's a simple fix to just use the user-specified server host when creating the JMX connection URL

-------------
Patch Level 3

- https://jira.terracotta.org/jira/browse/CDV-882
- made lock refresh cancelable, synchronize the selection
  of server locks with client locks and vice versa, added Inspect lock object
  context menu item.
